# Pixel Preservation Project

A fantasy frontend for a retro games database

---

## About

This project is:
- An exercise in frontend dev with vanilla JS
- A framework detox to get over my Svelte attachment issues
- An assignment submission for CS2003
- A source of much late-night pain and suffering
- Literally just a CRUD UI for an ephemeral dataset

## Usage instructions

I spent way too long trying to make the page as intuitive as possible, so if you can't figure out how to use it, I'm gonna go cry in a corner.

A GitHub Pages deployment can be found at [thatotherandrew.github.io/PixelPreservationProject](https://thatotherandrew.github.io/PixelPreservationProject/).

## Build instructions

There's none. nada. zilch.

It's just plain ol' HTML+CSS+JS. The entire site is in `src/`, just open `index.html` in a browser and you're good to go.

## Overview

This assignment involved using vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript to design and construct a frontend for a dataset of retro games, implementing a user interface to enable simple CRUD operations in addition to more advanced sorting and searching/filtering functionality. These requirements were fully achieved and implemented, with comprehensive testing to ensure functionality, performance, and accessibility standards were met.

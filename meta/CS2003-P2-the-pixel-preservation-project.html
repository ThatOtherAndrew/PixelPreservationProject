    </h3>
    <!--l. 29-->
    <p class="noindent">
      You’ve inherited a garage full of vintage video games (cartridges, floppy
      disks in huge boxes, jewel cased CD-ROM). Rather then letting them decay,
      you have decided to dedicate all your free time to archiving them
      digitally by building a interactive web site that lets users view, search,
      add, and manage a catalogue of classic games.
      <!--l. 31-->
    </p>

    <p class="noindent">
      Your task is to build a single page web application that will allow users
      to view and manage the catalogue. You will need to use the following
      technologies:
    </p>

    <ul class="itemize1">
      <li class="itemize">
        <!--l. 34-->
        <p class="noindent">HTML5 for the structure of web pages,</p>
      </li>

      <li class="itemize">
        <!--l. 35-->
        <p class="noindent">CSS3 for presentation of web pages,</p>
      </li>

      <li class="itemize">
        <!--l. 36-->
        <p class="noindent">JavaScript for client-side programming.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <!--l. 40-->
    <p class="noindent">
      This task is split into several parts of increasing complexity. You are
      strongly encouraged to complete them in the stated order and not move onto
      the more advanced tasks until you are happy with your solution to the more
      basic tasks. The tasks build on each other and should be submitted as a
      single project.
      <!--l. 43-->
    </p>

    <p class="noindent">
      You are not allowed to use 3rd party libraries, frameworks, or
      preprocessors (such as React or SCSS).
      <!--l. 46-->
    </p>

    <p class="noindent">
      The suggested structure is that there is an index.html, a style.css, and
      one or more JavaScript files. However, you should feel free to diverge
      from this as you see fit and can justify in your report.
      <!--l. 49-->
    </p>

    <p class="noindent">
      Your application must be runnable via a locally running webserver on the
      lab machines. You can serve a local webpage on a lab machine by running
      the following command, "python3 -m http.server port number" in the folder
      that you want to serve.
      <!--l. 54-->

    </h3>
    <!--l. 55-->
    <p class="noindent">
      Some of the games have already been catalogued and their information
      stored as JavaScript object literals, one for each game. This current
      state of the catalogue is provided in the file games.js (found on
      Studres).
      <!--l. 57-->
    </p>

    <p class="noindent">Each object stores the following information:</p>
    <ul class="itemize1">
      <li class="itemize">
        <!--l. 60-->
        <p class="noindent">
          Title: the name of the game, a string that must be less than or equal
          to 40 characters in length.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li class="itemize">
        <!--l. 61-->
        <p class="noindent">
          Platform: The type of computer or console the game runs on. This can
          have one of the following values: NES, SNES, PS1, PC, or AMIGA.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li class="itemize">
        <!--l. 62-->
        <p class="noindent">
          Genre: the genre the game is in, a string that must be less than or
          equal to 20 characters in length.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li class="itemize">
        <!--l. 63-->
        <p class="noindent">
          Description: A short description of the game, a string that must be
          less than or equal to 200 characters in length.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <!--l. 66-->
    <p class="noindent">
      Note that all of these fields are required and cannot be missing or left
      blank.
      <!--l. 68-->
    </p>

    <p class="noindent">
      You are free to load and transform games.js as you see fit, selecting
      appropriate data structures for your implementation. However, entries in
      the catalogue must conform to the above constraints for their properties.
      Do not edit games.js, though you may include it in your project. If you
      do, please ensure that it is included in your submission. Note that this
      application is not required to persist the data between reloads of the
      page.

    <p class="noindent">
      We recommend an incremental approach: make sure that each part of your
      program works before moving on to the next part. Make a safe copy of
      whatever you have got working so far so that you always have a working
      solution to submit while you are developing the next part of your
      solution. This should allow you to experiment with different ways of
      organising your code and implementing functionality without worrying of
      breaking things.

          A poor implementation in the 7-10 grade band will contain part of the
          solution that demonstrates some understanding of main concepts but
          does not work reliably and misses much of the functionality needed for
          Basic Functionality.

          Functionality. The report should demonstrate understanding of basic

          submissions where there are weaknesses or the report demonstrates a
          lack of understanding.
